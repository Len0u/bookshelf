# BookLog - Personal Reading Tracker

A full-stack app to track your reading journey. Built with React, Node.js, and MongoDB, BookLog helps you manage your personal library, set reading goals, and visualize your reading patterns.

## Deployment

BookLog is live!  
You can try the app here:

- **Live Demo**: [https://bookshelf-woad-two.vercel.app](https://bookshelf-woad-two.vercel.app)

> The backend is hosted on Render (free tier), so the app may take a few seconds to load initially due to server spin-up time.


## Features

- **Reading Status Tracking**: Mark books as "To Be Read", "Reading", or "Finished"
- **Reading Dates**: Track when you started and finished each book

## Note from the Developer

This project was built as a personal learning experience in full-stack development. I used AI to help me figure things out along the way — especially for debugging and understanding new tools. But I built it myself, start to finish. It shows my growth, curiosity, and commitment to building something real while learning along the way.
